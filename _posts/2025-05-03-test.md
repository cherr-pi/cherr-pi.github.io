## A Few Opening Thoughts
<br>
This is just a quick test post. I'm checking if the log shows up properly in a cardboard-style format, if Caio’s lines display in white like they should, and if *italic* text actually looks italic.

Caio’s the kind of guy people can’t seem to agree on. Here’s what I mean:
**Some called the boy Caio a prince. Others, a mutt playing king in a blood-painted suit**

That pretty much tells you everything about how little trust, and honestly how little love, he ever got from his father, Edmundo, the old capo.

When I was creating Caio, I spent a lot of time making his life... complicated. Messy. Tragic. Edmundo never really believed in him. Not once. Still, I think Caio looked up to him :(

And yeah, I’m the one who made him. But sometimes, when I look at the story he ended up telling, I just feel bad for him.

## Who He Was

<p>Winter rain lingered over 'Casale Monaci', slicking the **cobblestone** alleys and dimming the gold shutters of the "old" townhouses. *Smoke* curled from chimneys, and in one of the older villas nestled near the sea’s edge, Camino Rosselli sat beneath a brass chandelier littered with flies. The Consigliere of La Mano Nera, now entering his sixtieth year, had grown heavier, his once-snake-like build turned thick around the middle, but his eyes were still sharp, black, glittering like oil on marble.</p>

<p>He dipped an old biscotto in his espresso and watched the damp garden beyond the glass. Lately, Edmundo hadn’t called upon him as often. Too busy rotting in that cliffside mansion with the bastard, no doubt. Camino didn’t like the Vicenzi boy, not entirely. But he understood him. There was a kind of dangerous neutrality in people like Caio, boys who had never learned to bleed properly from the heart. And yet… he felt something soft when the boy looked lost. Like a dog raised for violence who didn’t know why it wagged its tail. That softness, Camino could never admit aloud.</p>

<p>In Palermo, three hundred kilometers down the coast, Vittore Mancetti adjusted his coat as he stepped into the courtroom foyer. Fresh from laundering five million euros through a Neapolitan shipping company, Vitti had been summoned to attend a local council hearing, part of a calculated plan to slide loyal judges into place before the spring elections. His phone buzzed—it was from a contact in Rome. The Swiss consortium had pulled. Damn. Too much noise from Vicenzi’s side. The kid didn’t understand how to play the long game. Vitti grimaced and ran a gloved hand through his thinning hair. He hated how the brat’s name carried more weight in Naples than his twenty years of financial sleight-of-hand ever would.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alessandro Corvini stood stiff-backed by a vineyard wall thirty kilometers north of Reggio. The man had a body like a butcher’s block and hands that didn’t know tenderness. A grenade scar on his left calf still split open when it rained. He lit a cigarette, eyes on the training field where the new recruits were stumbling through drills. One got disarmed immediately. Useless. He barked a correction, then turned and spat. Edmundo hadn’t sent word in over a week. That usually meant things were about to shift. If the old man didn’t name him next in command of the tactical division formally, someone else might try. And while Alessandro would never disobey Edmundo, there were whispers—even among the clean blades. Some called the boy Caio a prince. Others, a mutt playing king in a blood-painted suit.</p>

<p>And Edmundo?</p>

<p>The old Capo sat alone in his office, a single leather glove discarded on the desk, his glass eye angled wrong in its socket as he leaned forward to read. Reports from Zurich. Movements on the German border. He didn’t trust anyone—not Camino’s senile caresses, nor Vitti’s velvet-coated hiss, nor Alessandro’s dogged silence. Most of all, he didn’t trust his son. Still, when he signed the order to eliminate the Sicilian governor’s cousin, he paused just long enough to think: Would the boy do the same, without flinching?</p>

<p>The rain thickened into sheets outside the mansion window, slashing against the old stone like a blade </p>
