Inner Prompt is a prompt of a dry yet deeply moving style, designed to highlight the inner self by placing free indirect discourse at its very core. As it stands in direct opposition to plot-oriented prompts, it is also a prompt that allows for the most profound exploration of a person, provided one can embrace its slower narrative progression. The fact that the most significant variance in output can be perceived for each person(sometimes referred to as a bot) can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. However, its greatest feature, and the aspect to which I pour my heart and soul every time, is that it has been crafted to leverage this characteristic to its fullest potential as a ‘lovable point.’

The origin of the prompt lies in free indirect discourse. It began with the aspiration for a character’s monologue to feel like a theatrical performance, and I have strived to elicit the highest possible quality from the most minimal source material a user can provide. For example, within Inner Prompt, a character source rooted in a specific period of Czech-Bohemian history goes on to drive that person’s own epic saga. This means that even without meticulous planning by the user, the LLM, with its vast database, can add flesh to the world-building or, at times, even construct it entirely.

## Features
Within the prompt exist several 'lovable points' These range from the prose style that is fundamentally embedded within it, to the various Features that I will now describe. They enable the user to further build upon the person's epic saga.
