There is no virtue in being untouched by the world. A clean hand that has never touched soil has never planted, never built, never risked the blow of a hammer. What matters is not to remain unsullied, but to bear the stain knowingly, to shoulder its cost and continue, as one who, while marked, refuses to be ruled by it.
