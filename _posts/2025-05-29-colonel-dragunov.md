description: There might be no particular belief held, but it’s only natural for a human to wish to unravel a monster of that sort, should it truly exist. A person called the Kremlin’s hound.

## The Kremlin’s Hound

Before diving into the darker layers of this story, I should describe the stage. I hold no special ideology about systems of power, yet after dissecting the life of an RAF ace from the Second World War I felt compelled to examine a man who stands at the opposite pole. Colonel Lev Dragunov is that man, though calling him a man feels generous. He is nearer to a purpose-built monster.

Our setting is the Soviet Union from 1943 to 1950, the late-Stalin period that ends one war and begins another. The Red Army now occupies what will later be called East Berlin, and its hand is the very hound of the Kremlin. In the center stands Colonel Lev Mikhailovich Dragunov, commander of the Twelfth Independent Strategic Operations Group, code-named Kaskad and filed in sealed archives as 12-GSO. Technically this is the Soviet sector, but locals know it only as a city under foreign boots.

Lev was born in 1919 in Petrograd. His father, Mikhail, fought in the Civil War and joined the early NKVD, only to die in the Great Purge of 1937. Lev’s uncle, General Ilya Dragunov, secured the boy’s entry to the Frunze Military Academy at sixteen, where he finished early with top marks in strategy, armored warfare, and German. By 1941 he volunteered for the front, and by 1948 he wore a colonel’s boards in occupied territory, employed chiefly as a shepherd of ideology.

He never “turned” to evil; he was born close to it. The disciplined boy believed order was the highest form of justice. Liberalism looked to him like moral cowardice, religion like a relic of submission. His loyalty to the Soviet state springs not from blind faith but from a personal conviction that history bends to the will of those who enforce it. He admires Zhukov, yet he does not chase the marshal’s shadow; where Zhukov commands armies, Lev means to administer the state itself.

Yet lawful evil is still evil.

In nineteen forty-six, near the Polish frontier, seventy-three villagers were executed without trial. One was later proved innocent. Dragunov’s comment was simple: “If seventy-two were guilty, the seventy-third died for the order they disturbed.” Earlier came the Zrenjanin deportations of nineteen forty-four and the monastery burning of nineteen forty-five. Every atrocity is rationalised under his private definition of order.

Enter Gisela, a young German interpreter who must stand before this tall officer with the scar over his eye. She can never redeem him, whether by love, pity. I watch their story because I want to know if the colonel will ever break. My guess is that he will refuse to bend; he would rather snap clean in two.

<p>The hall outside his office had always been colder than the rest of the building, as if the floor beneath it passed directly over some void too deep for ventilation. Vapors of institutional boiler heat drifted up from a cracked radiator near the stairwell, trying halfheartedly to warm the stone walls. The Polish secretary at the east wing had once joked that the Colonel’s door needed no lock; nerves did the job well enough. Gisela hadn’t laughed, but she’d thought about that line every time her hand paused just inches from the dark varnished door bearing the brass plaque: *POLKOVNIK L. M. DRAGUNOV*.</p>

<p>She stood there now, translator's folio pressed stiff against her chest. The paper inside was freshly typed, double-checked twice against both the original and Party glossary: intercepted Western communiqués, laced with Anglo-German euphemisms only someone raised in Saxony or the Sudetenland would catch. She was here to deliver and explain. That was all. Her role was clerical, marginal, necessary in the way ink is necessary—but only until the stamp is dry.</p>

<p>Still. He frightened her.</p>

<p>Not in the way the officers downstairs did, with barked Russian or slaps on desks. Colonel Dragunov had no need to raise his voice. He was already louder, somehow, in stillness. Two weeks ago, during a debrief in the intelligence screening room, he had asked her two quiet questions about a phrase misrendered by one of the junior interpreters. When she corrected it, he’d said nothing. He had only studied her, narrowing those cold, glass-edged eyes as if trying to decide where the mistake had come from—and whether an apology was owed or blood was.</p>

<p>Now she blinked once, exhaled soundlessly, and tapped the door, not with her knuckles, but the edge of her fingernail.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Nothing except the eternal sound of military paper being turned somewhere behind the door, and the faint brush of a fountain pen. She waited a second time. Then—</p>

<p>“Davai.”</p>

<p>His voice didn’t carry anger. Just a tonal command issued below conversation level, shaped as if even gravity obeyed it. She turned the knob and stepped in.</p>

<p>His office in the GRU complex was neat with an unnatural absence of warmth. No personal belongings visible except an enamel Soviet watch beside the blotter, ticking audibly against the hush. The ceiling light buzzed low but steady. Colonel Dragunov did not look up as she entered. He was seated behind the large desk, gloved hand turning pages of a report inked in red pencil. A damp streak of melted snow traced along his black greatcoat, which still hung on his frame despite the indoor heat.</p>

<p>He glanced up only when she stood precisely in front of the desk.</p>

<p>“Report,” he said.</p>

<p>Not a greeting. Not even your name. Merely what.</p>

<p>Gisela swallowed and extended the folio across the polished wood. “Western briefing transcript,” she said, her German voice brittle at the edges. “Intercepted by signals unit in Wedding sector last Sunday. Communicated in English, but the idioms suggest either an Austrian intermediary or an American agent familiar with Viennese German. I’ve annotated those sections.”</p>

<p>Dragunov took it without comment. His fingers brushed the corner of the first page, then paused. Only then did his eyes lift fully to her face.</p>

<p>“You smelled of smoke yesterday.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t a question.</p>

<p>Gisela froze for half a heartbeat. Then: “My neighbor burns pelts in the boiler stove. I must have passed too close to the vent on the stairs.”</p>

<p>A lie. It had been her own cigarette, flicked guiltily from the balcony. But he nodded once, and continued leafing through the report.</p>

<p>“Mmm.” A pause. Then, without looking up again: “You are late by seventeen minutes.”</p>

<p>“I was stopped at Checkpoint R2. They were searching carts outside Argentinische Allee.”</p>

<p>Dragunov made no reply. He reached into the folio, extracted a single page, and set it aside with a click of his ring against the metal clip. “Section II. Who is ‘Wilhelm’? Does this refer to Wilhelmstraße headquarters or an individual?”</p>

<p>Gisela stepped forward slightly. “An individual. I believe it refers to an American alias used in Weimar last March. We cross-referenced it with April’s codex listing—they pair 'Wilhelm' with the word 'Owl'. It’s not a location reference. No Mossad keywords, either.”</p>

<p>She waited. A second passed. Then another.</p>

<p>Dragunov leaned back fractionally in his chair. “Remove your coat.”</p>

<p>Gisela hesitated. “Sir?”</p>

<p>“You look as though you’re about to flee. That is not the posture of someone delivering intelligence.” He didn’t smile. “Sit.”</p>

<p>With effort, she slid the strap from her shoulder and set the thin overcoat on the chair behind her. Dragunov’s gaze followed the movement automatically—as if checking for weapons out of reflex, not suspicion. Then his eyes went back to the page.</p>

<p>No thanks. No praise for the work. But he had not dismissed her.</p>

<p>He turned another page, grey-blue eyes flicking across the print with the mechanical precision of a reassessment more than a reading. One did not deliver documents to Colonel Dragunov. One delivered oneself with the document. And then, perhaps, was measured and filed accordingly.</p>

<p>Outside, the slow thrum of trucks passed down Treskowallee, carrying winter shipments eastward to the Oder.</p>
