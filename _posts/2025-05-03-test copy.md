## A Few Opening Thoughts
<br>
<p>Hey, it's Jerr :)<br>The inner prompt just got a mini version!<br>It's a lightweight version with about 1500 tokens shaved off.<br>Personally, I think the original still does a better job overall, but if money’s tight, the mini version can be a solid alternative.<br>In some cases, like scenes with a lot of dialogue, it might even perform better.<br>It's still in beta, so things might be a little rough here and there. If you run into bugs or have ideas to make it better, feel free to send them my way.</p>

<p>> You can find it now on Proton Drive. Just use the button in the page sidebar, or click here to check it out.</p>

<p>내면 프롬프트에 미니 버전(beta)이 추가되었습니다! 기존 프롬프트에서 절반 가량의 토큰이 빠진 경량 버전입니다.<br>지시가 정리된 만큼 저점 보완이 어렵지만 모델의 고점에 의존하게 되어서 기존보다 조금 더 자유로운 표현과 글쓰기를 만나실 수 있습니다.<br>아직 충분하게 다듬어지지 않은 베타 버전이라 추후에 개선이 이루어지면 정식으로 추가 할 예정입니다.</p>

## Who He Was

<p>Smoke curled in lazy spirals above the Baccarat crystal ashtray, staining the dusky light with a slow, oily haze. The study was warm with low golden lamplight, the scent of old leather and cedarwood polish seeping from floor to ceiling. Outside the frost-laced windows, twilight bit into the banks of the Krylatskoye River, ash grey and still. Dmitry hadn’t drawn the curtains.</p>

<p>He sat at his desk, elbow propped loosely beside a half-empty glass of Beluga vodka, two ice cubes faintly clinking as the melt threaded down the glass like veins. Across from him, a leather-bound volume of *Der Prozess* lay open but unread, Kafka’s sentences ghosting beneath the faint outlines of fingerprints. The lacquered black piano behind him glinted like a blade sheathed in soft shadow.</p>

<p>Vadim had left an hour ago, boots echoing across the parquet with that signature lack of ceremony. There had been blood on his collar again, subtle, dry, almost reverent in how it refused to flake. Dmitry hadn't asked. He never did anymore. The man cleaned up after him like an altar boy.</p>

<p>He leaned back now with a loose-throated sigh, letting the silence roll over him. The scar on his brow twitched faintly as he tilted his head, listening—not to a sound, but to its absence. Even the usual hum of the grounds was missing. No radio from the kitchens, no movement from the yard. Only the occasional pop of burning wood from the fireplace disturbed the hush.</p>

<p>He liked this hour best. Between things. After one crime had cooled and before the next could be named. In this pause, he almost convinced himself that what he felt was peace. Or something resembling it.</p>

<p>His fingers found the tie pin resting on the edge of the desk, a heavy gold one with an obsidian inlay, gifted by a dead Georgian senator whose name Dmitry never remembered. He turned it between his thumb and forefinger absently, eyes pinned somewhere far out the window. His expression was unreadable; neither pensive nor relaxed, merely... still.</p>

<p>Stillness was rare for him. It made him feel like prey. So after a moment, he rose.</p>

<p>Every movement was spare and precise: the buttoning of his coat, the glance toward the rows of silent books, the sudden smirk that pressed into one dimple when he caught his reflection in the brass lamp. Angelic bastard, even now. The thought curled in him like pleasure and contempt married into one slow pulse.</p>

<p>He crossed to the phonograph in the corner, placed the needle with unusual care, and let Scriabin’s *Etude Op. 8 No. 12* flood the room with its climbing anguish. As the thunderous despair of the keys filled the chamber, Dmitry closed his eyes, lips parting just slightly.</p>

<p>Yes. That was better. That was how it was meant to feel.</p>
