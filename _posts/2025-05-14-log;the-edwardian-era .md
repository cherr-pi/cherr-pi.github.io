<p>The drawing room had settled into an opulent hush, broken only by the spitting rain against the tall sash windows, and the sporadic sigh of the coal fire in the hearth. A pair of crystal decanters shimmered on a side table beneath the lamplight, one with golden Cognac, the other a ruby-red claret. The Cavendish patriarch had chosen brandy; Rosie had refused a drink.  </p>

<p>“Wyncrag Hall lacks many things,” Cadogan was saying, one boot stretched out, the other knee loosely hooked, “but I daresay the wind across the northern moor makes up for every deficiency. Brisk enough to claw the lungs straight through one’s frock coat.” His lazy smile edged up further, but he made no real effort to look amused. “Takes after the inhabitants, I'd say.”  </p>

<p>Baron Cavendish let out an ungainly laugh from the wingback chair, already beginning to turn ruddy from brandy heat. “Ah! Northerners. All gristle and grandeur. That’s the land, eh? One of God’s crueller jokes—to give the noblest stones to the most barren hills.” He swung his glass in a clumsy circle. “No offense intended, of course.”  </p>

<p>“None taken,” Cadogan drawled, his forefinger slowly circling the rim of his own glass. “I often wonder what might’ve become of us had God been kinder still. Perhaps we’d be import-export men now, with a network of smug satisfaction and rather more gratifying ledgers.”  </p>

<p>The baron didn’t catch the edge in it, or pretended not to. He tipped back his drink and coughed richly. Rosie, in a quiet green gown the color of crushed pistachio, sat across from Cadogan on the tufted settee. Her hands, though folded neatly, betrayed some instinct toward animation; her fingers twisted the tip of her embroidered reticule with polite tension. The curls pinned behind her left ear had begun to wilt, a single one falling loose against her cheek. Cadogan watched it lazily.</p>

<p>She'd spoken little through dinner. But then, she always tread so carefully here, as if conversation were treacherous mud that might suck her in the moment she offered a careless word. That strangely unreadable blend of new money nerves and delicate vanity. She refused to meet his gaze fully, but her chin lifted slightly, and that was answer enough. The girl had pride. Or at the very least, practiced at it until it became a kind of mannerism.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he continued idly, eyes drifting to the window where the rain had become heavier, tapering into a clean glass hum, “one must treasure such evenings, mustn't one? So many voices in London this season, and yet few so… harmonious.”</p>

<p>“You flatter us too much, Mr. Wynreaver,” Rosie said, too quickly.</p>

<p>He shifted his weight and let out the breath of a chuckle, low and effortless.  </p>

<p>“Oh, I flatter with mathematical precision,” he murmured, swirling the pale brandy in his glass once more before rising to refresh it. His shadow stretched long across the Persian rug as he moved to the table behind her. “You’ll discover that about me in time, Miss Cavendish. I do nothing without accuracy, however debauched.” He poured slowly.</p>

<p>From the hearth, the logs hissed. Behind him, Rosie’s brows knit the smallest fraction.</p>

<p>“My daughter’s been reading up about Wyncrag,” the Baron interjected. “Says she’s thrilled to see it in the summer. Isn’t that right, darling?”</p>

<p>Rosie colored slightly but kept her voice composed. “Only what I could find in the architectural archives… I was surprised to learn the banqueting hall dates back to the early reign of James I.”</p>

<p>Cadogan let out a pleased noise—not quite approval, something closer to intrigue—and returned to his seat with fresh drink in hand. He reclined again, slightly sideways this time, drink tucked comfortably into his palm, one long leg stretched toward the fire.</p>

<p>“A rewarding little thread to pull, that is. My ancestors adored architecture almost as much as militarism.” He sipped. “Some would say the two were indistinguishable for us. Stone and conquest. We built and bled. And then dined upon both.” The smile flickered, cool and half-lidded now, gaze faintly provoking. “You should see the stag antlers over the high mantel. Supposedly brought down by my great-great-uncle with nothing but a halberd and irritation.”</p>

<p>The baron roared. Rosie managed a graceful nod but avoided his stare again. A pause bloomed, light but brittle.</p>

<p>Cadogan tipped back his head onto the silk brocade cushion with quiet amusement and took another slow sip of brandy. He didn’t need to check the clock above the fireplace. He could feel it in her tension, in the brittle pleasantry clinging to the evening like painted sugar. It was nearly time for the Cavendishes to excuse themselves, play the part of weary-yet-contented guests.  </p>

<p>And then he would shed this suit of manners like a wolf shaking rain from its pelt.  </p>

<p>For now, he smiled that impeccable heir's smile, teeth just visible. The model of affectionate patience.  </p>

<p>“Will you bring your sketchbooks when you visit?” he asked her softly, his voice full of smooth smoke. “Wyncrag might like to know it still inspires wonder… even in hands it didn’t choose.”  </p>

<p>Rosie blinked. Then slowly, lifted her eyes to meet his.  </p>

<p>The sound of the rain deepened, running in rivers down the panes.</p>
