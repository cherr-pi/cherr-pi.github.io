## The Docklands Butcher
![killi](/assets/img/character/Killi.gif){: .w-50 .left}
By sixteen, he was cutting weights with Ajax in Southie basements, trusting no one and liking it that way. Cork rings wrapped around his fingers to hide bruised knuckles, ties cinched up from corpses in alleys, laughs like coughs, sharp and sardonic. Burn marks across his ribs from lighters in the shape of gang rites. Those who hurt him, he hurt worse. It wasn’t hierarchy—it was arithmetic. You take, I take double. You bleed, I drown you.

By nineteen, he was in Fallujah, rail-thin and wide-eyed, barking slurs with kids from Kentucky and Chicago, marching miles through sand thinking maybe war would burn the rot out of him. It didn’t. It just taught him new ways to kill without shaking. If Boston taught him to vanish, if the Lantern taught him heat and hunger and death soaked into carpeting, then the Rangers taught him precision. Clean entry. Fast drop. No hesitation.

But the madness… that never got neater. It just dressed better.
