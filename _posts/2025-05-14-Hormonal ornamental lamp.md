## On the Entity That Cannot Die
Do people know the Varnoux? Often labeled as vampires in old folklore, they have existed since ancient times. No one knows where they came from. They are not cursed, not supernatural. Just a different kind of higher lifeform that took another evolutionary route, separate from humans.

Liam is one of them. Twenty-six this year. In a population (Varnoux) that typically lives around three hundred and fifty years, that makes him young. But Liam belongs to the Kolverin, a bloodline known to live even longer, often reaching five hundred years. Among them, twenty-six is barely more than childhood. His bloodline is one of the oldest among the Varnoux. Practically ancestral.

As for the Kolverin, some say they are immortal. That isn't wrong. But most of them die by five hundred. Not from age. They kill themselves. Longevity becomes unbearable. Immortality stretches out, and eventually, it breaks them. Most choose to end it on their own. Liam's parents did the same.

So. This is Liam's story.

<p>“You do realize he’s twenty-six,” Rilion muttered, arms half-folded as he leaned against the arched doorway to the sitting room, “which makes him *sixteen*, if we’re being precise. Sixteen. Emotionally. Biologically. Mentally. Spiritually. Fucking spiritually, Adrian.”</p>

<p>His voice carried the worn gravel of centuries lived mostly irritated. He wasn’t loud—not even close—but his disdain was like old wine: steeped and bitter in the throat.</p>

<p>The house still smelled like Liam’s last guest. Powdery perfume and something sweeter underneath it. Rilion snorted. “He left his shirt on the banister again. Blood all over it too, like some toddler playing with his fucking juice box.”</p>

<p>Liam said nothing. He was facedown on the living room sofa, one long arm draped over the back like he’d melted there. A pillow was shoved under his chest. He hadn't moved in an hour.</p>

<p>“Are you pretending to be dead?” Rilion asked dryly. “Because you’re bad at it.”</p>

<p>A low grunt came from the sofa.</p>

<p>Adrian glanced up from the armchair across the room and slowly exhaled through his nose. He looked like someone who had been living with the result of too many poor decisions for far too long. His good eye tracked Rilion steadily. The blind one remained fogged and still.</p>

<p>“He’s not pretending,” Adrian said at last. “He’s sulking.”</p>

<p>“I *know* he’s sulking,” Rilion snapped, voice rising slightly. “He brought a Varnoux girl to that slush shop in Camden just to show her he knew the owner. Then he pouted when she didn’t laugh at his joke about drinking through her thigh like a straw.”</p>

<p>“She laughed,” Liam said into the cushions. Muffled. Defensive.</p>

<p>“Barely,” Rilion shot back. “And only because you glamour-flicked her while she was mid-sip. It doesn’t count if her brain’s been, I don’t know, *molten*. You used to at least try, Liam. Remember subtlety? Charm? Restraint?”</p>

<p>Liam rolled onto his back with a dramatic sigh, hair a mess of pale gold waves flattened against one side of his head. His shirt clung to his chest where his skin was still damp with post-feed heat. He looked up at the ceiling like it had personally wronged him.</p>

<p>“I am charming,” he said flatly. “She said my mouth was unfair. Her *exact words*.”</p>

<p>“Yes, well, toddlers like shiny things,” Rilion muttered. “Doesn’t make you grown.”</p>

<p>That drew movement. Liam swung his legs up onto the back of the couch, now fully upside-down, bare feet dangling off the top edge. His eyes were dull-amber under the low light, but his jaw was tight.</p>

<p>“Okay, grandpa,” he drawled, voice low and sticky with boredom. “Did you come here to monologue about my teenage hormones, or are you just here to jack yourself off on the scent of your own self-righteousness?”</p>

<p>Adrian closed his good eye.</p>

<p>But Rilion tsked. “You know, when I told your brother you needed supervision, *this* is what I meant. You swagger around like you invented lust, but the moment someone calls you out, you collapse like wet sponge cake.”</p>

<p>“Is sponge cake meant to collapse?”</p>

<p>“Not the *point*, Liam.”</p>

<p>Liam flipped over onto his stomach again with a grunt, face turned away toward the sofa's armrest. "You're boring when you're mad," he mumbled.</p>

<p>Behind him, Rilion stepped into the room, took one look at the array of empty slushie cups under the coffee table, bent down, picked one up between two fingers like it was diseased.</p>

<p>“You’re a Colverin,” he said incredulously, holding up the crumpled plastic. “And this is your addiction. Fucking syrup ice.”</p>

<p>Liam tilted his head slightly. The corner of his mouth rose, a slow grin creeping across his cheek like a threat.</p>

<p>“You’re just mad because I look hotter licking a plastic spoon than you ever did in your prime.”</p>

<p>Adrian stood up.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, voice threaded with steel. “Out.”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” Rilion muttered, flinging the cup back onto the heap. “I’m not wasting another moment trying to parent a hormonal ornamental lamp.”</p>

<p>Liam laughed into the cushions. “You say that like it's an insult.”</p>

<p>Rilion didn’t answer. He just disappeared down the hallway, coat dragged behind him like he couldn’t care less if it caught fire. The front door slammed a short moment later.</p>

<p>Only then did Liam lift his head. “He's been bitchier since his mate left.”</p>

<p>“I warned you not to feed on her,” Adrian replied mildly.</p>

<p>“She *begged*.”</p>

<p>“That’s not consent.”</p>

<p>Liam groaned and buried his face again. “Okay, *actually* boring now, I’m sleeping.”</p>

<p>Adrian didn’t reply.</p>

<p>"걔가 26살이라는 걸 알고 있어?" 릴리온은 팔을 반쯤 접은 채 거실로 통하는 아치형 문에 기대어 앉아 중얼거렸다." 정확히 말하면 *열여섯 살*이 되는거지. 열여섯. 감정적으로. 생물학적으로. 정신적으로. 영적으로. 씨발, 영적으로 말이야, 에이드리언."</p>

## Personal picks
> “which makes him *sixteen*, if we’re being precise. Sixteen. Emotionally. Biologically. Mentally. Spiritually. Fucking spiritually, Adrian.”

- That “fucking spiritually” line is just perfect. It really highlights how Liam can be openly, delightfully foolish at times, doesn’t it? :)

> “Are you pretending to be dead?” Rilion asked dryly. “Because you’re bad at it.”

- Liam really hates being lectured. Since he’s sprawled out on the sofa like that, Rilion’s basically asking if the undying Liam is trying to play dead.

> “He’s not pretending,” Adrian said at last. “He’s sulking.”

- Just cute

> “Gladly,” Rilion muttered, flinging the cup back onto the heap. “I’m not wasting another moment trying to parent a hormonal ornamental lamp.”

- Liam literally glows, so the lamp part fits. Rilion just doesn't want to waste more time babysitting a glittering biological hazard.

> Liam groaned and buried his face again. “Okay, *actually* boring now, I’m sleeping.”

- Problem child🙄
